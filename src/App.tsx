          I am a <b>front-end developer</b> with over <b>5 years of experience</b>, driven by the joy of bringing ideas to life.
          One of the things I love most about front-end development is the immediate impact of my workâ€”something
          as simple as adjusting a color or font can transform a user's experience. But for me, it's not just
          about building websites or applications. My <b>goal</b> is to create <b>useful and meaningful experiences</b> that
          truly serve the users.
          <br /><br />
          I stay up-to-date by <b>following tech bloggers</b> and regularly updating <b>my own Telegram channel</b> where I
          share insights on front-end and IT. I also keep a close eye on the latest documentation for the tools
          I use and enjoy diving into tech content on YouTube.
          <br /><br />
          What matters most to me in a team is a strong connection on a mental level. I'm an active,
          friendly person, and I believe that while we're working in tech, the human connection within the team
          is key. I'm always <b>looking for like-minded collaborators</b> who are just as passionate about creating
          meaningful products.

            Now I am woking with Improvado's SPA, which is used by companies
            like Coca-Cola, L'Oreal, Philips etc. During the period of my work, I
            participated in several integration with <b>third-party services</b>,
            project <b>architecture migration</b>, <b>test implementation</b>, and so on. I
            am currently looking for a position in a strong and ambitious
            team with a complex product, so if you don't mind working
            together, contact me!
