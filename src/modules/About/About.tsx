                I am a <b>front-end developer</b> with over <b>5 years of experience</b>, driven by the joy of bringing ideas to life.
                One of the things I love most about front-end development is the immediate impact of my workâ€”something
                as simple as adjusting a color or font can transform a user's experience. But for me, it's not just
                about building websites or applications. My <b>goal</b> is to create <b>useful and meaningful experiences</b> that
                truly serve the users.
                <br /><br />
                I stay up-to-date by <b>following tech bloggers</b> and regularly updating <b>my own Telegram channel</b> where I
                share insights on front-end and IT. I also keep a close eye on the latest documentation for the tools
                I use and enjoy diving into tech content on YouTube.
                <br /><br />
                What matters most to me in a team is a strong connection on a mental level. I'm an active,
                friendly person, and I believe that while we're working in tech, the human connection within the team
                is key. I'm always <b>looking for like-minded collaborators</b> who are just as passionate about creating
                meaningful products.
